# MINIMALIST TASKER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: The purpose of this project is to create a simple terminal application that allows us to create a database for our tasks, either an individual one or one for each project. The app will use the database to load, save and store the tasks which will be added to it, each with a priority level, an automatically generated id and a task description. The app will present these tasks in a table, ordered by priority and allow the user to add new tasks, remove the completed ones and modify either the priority or the description.
